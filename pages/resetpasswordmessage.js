// This code is for the "Reset Password Message" component. It is a functional component written in JavaScript and uses JSX syntax. 
// 
// The component returns a simple HTML paragraph element that displays a message to the user after their password has been reset. The message instructs the user to try logging in with their new password. 
// 
// The component does not have any props or state, and it does not perform any additional logic or actions. It is only responsible for displaying the message to the user. 
// 
// The component is exported as the default export and can be imported and used in other parts of the application. 
// 
// The component is used to provide feedback and guidance to the user after a password reset operation. It helps to improve the user experience by providing clear instructions on what to do next.
